# Your company owns a video watching platform.  Users can click to start to play the video and click stop to pause the video.  
# Your team is creating a real time dashboard to display the average viewing time of the users.  
# The data comes to you as as streaming data and includes a session_id, start_time (unix), and stop_time (unix). 
# The viewing time would be calculated as the stop_time - start_time.  
# The dashboard requires the average viewing time over all time.

# Write code to store and retrieve the required data efficiently. 
# When the average viewing time is queried, it must return a result in near real time. 
# You can assume the records will come 1 at a time and there will not be any duplicates.


# Example 1:
# Input:
# {
# {"session_id": 1, "start_time": 1626822000, "stop_time": 1626823200},
# {"session_id": 1, "start_time": 1626823500, "stop_time": 1626823800},
# {"session_id": 2, "start_time": 1626822600, "stop_time": 1626825600},
# {"session_id": 3, "start_time": 1626823800, "stop_time": 1626824700}
# }

# Output: 
# 1350


# The viewing time for each record is calculated as stop_time - start_time.  
# The average viewing time is the sum of the viewing time divided by the total number of records. 
# The calculation should be: 
# ((1626823200 - 1626822000) + (1626823800 - 1626823500) + (1626825600 - 1626822600) + (1626824700 - 1626823800))/4. 
# This yields the above output.
