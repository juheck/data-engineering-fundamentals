# You are charge of a dataset that contains the operational state of your company's servers clusters. 
# The Clusters dictionary contains information about which servers belong each cluster.  
# Below, cluster "A" includes servers 1, 2, and 3.  
# The Servers dictionary contains information about the operational state of each server.  
# The state will be 0 if the server is in a failed state and 1 if the server is in a successful state. 
# Some of the servers are shared among multiple clusters. 
# Below, server 4 is state 0, meaning it is in a failed state.



# Write code to return the number of clusters that have at least 1 server in a failed state. 
# Your code should accept a list of clusters as input.


# Clusters
# {
# "A": [1, 2, 3],
# "B": [3, 4, 5],
# "C": [2, 4, 6]
# }

# Servers
# {
# 1: 1,
# 2: 1,
# 3: 1,
# 4: 0,
# 5: 0,
# 6: 1,
# }



# Example 1:
# Input: ["A", "B", "C"]
# Output: 2

# Cluster A contains servers 1, 2, and 3.  
# Servers 1, 2, and 3 all have a state of 1, meaning none of them are failed. 
# Cluster A should not be included in our count.

# Cluster B contains servers 3, 4, and 5. 
# Servers 4, and 5 are in a failed state. 
# Cluster B should be included in our count. 
# Even though there are 2 failed servers in Cluster B, we should only increase our count by 1.

# Cluster C contains servers 2, 4, and 6. 
# Server 4 is in a failed state. 
# Cluster C should be included our count.



# Example 2:
# Input: ["A"]
# Output: 0

# Cluster A contains servers 1, 2, and 3.  
# Servers 1, 2, and 3 all have a state of 1, meaning none of them are failed. 
# Cluster A should not be included in our count.
